Thank you for taking interest in SourceAFIS for .NET. This document provides guidance for contributors.

## Repositories

Sources are mirrored on several sites. You can submit issues and pull requests on any of them.

## Issues

Both bug reports and feature requests are welcome. There is no free support, but it's perfectly reasonable to open issues asking for more documentation or better usability.

## Pull requests

Pull requests are generally welcome. If you would like to make large or controversial changes, please open an issue first to discuss your idea.

Don't worry too much about formatting and naming. Code will be reformatted after merge. Just avoid running your formatter on whole source files, because that makes diffs hard to understand.
